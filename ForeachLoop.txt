foreach loop:-

this is used to print the element of array index .The difference between for and for each 
loop is , we don't need to intialize the iteration process for forloop rather it would
accept all the array value and give its output..

the program for this is..

package com.technoelevate.javabasics.arrays;

public class ForEachLoop {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int arr[]= {12,34,23,45};
		for(int a:arr) {

			System.out.println(a);
		}
		

	}

}
