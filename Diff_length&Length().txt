Difference between length & length():-


length:-

this is used to check the array length size, so to validate the length of the array (array
index) we use "length" syntax.

ex- int a[] ={23,43,54,23,55};
so the array length is 5
so the syntax for length is:-   System.out.println(a.length);



length()  :-

it is a method used to check the element size of the perticular index in the array.
it will show the size of the element by counting its value.

ex-   String s[]={"Techno","elevate","test","yantra"};
so the first index element size is 7.  i.e elevate.
so the syntax for length is:-   System.out.println(s[1].length());
