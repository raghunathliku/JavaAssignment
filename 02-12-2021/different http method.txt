PATCH
PATCH is used to modify resources. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, 
not the complete resource.
In other words, the body should contain a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on 
the server should be modified to produce a new version.
DELETE
DELETE is quite easy to understand. It is used to delete a resource identified by filters or ID.
On successful deletion, the HTTP response status code 204 (No Content) returns with no response body.
HEAD
Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only.
PUT
Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
