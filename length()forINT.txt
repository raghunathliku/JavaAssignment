length()  :-


string.length() : length() method is a final variable which is applicable for string 
objects. The length() method returns the number of characters present in the string. 

 
so as it is returning only string value so it can accept only string value but for int value
 it can not fetch or read int value so , this method will show compile time error for int datatype.

ex-   String s[]={"Techno","elevate","test","yantra"};
so the first index element size is 7.  i.e elevate.
so the syntax for length is:-   System.out.println(s[1].length());
